<p><b>Command Line TV</b> is a video podcast to help you learn and master the
  Unix shell that underlies both the Mac and GNU/Linux operating systems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
“Pretty much everything useful I ever learned about Unix shells was not from
reading books or manuals, but by peering over someone’s shoulder and seeing
something I’d never seen before. ‘Ooooh, what was that you just did?’”
&mdash;Joe&nbsp;Walnes
