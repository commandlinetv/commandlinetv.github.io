Welcome to Command Line TV, a new video podcast to help you learn and master
the UNIX shell. In this first episode, we talk about our backgrounds, the scope
of this endeavor, opening your terminal, and using basic commands like `cd` and
`ls` to explore a directory tree.

You can follow along using the same directory structure by downloading it from
<https://github.com/commandlinetv/sample-files>.

*Note:* we have a few minor problems in this episode with audio synchronization
and a somewhat noisy environment. These will improve in the future!
